Description of Exercise:

Using the following code, combine the two names together to form a full name and assign that value to a variable named 
full_name. Then, print the value of full_name.

Initial Syntax Given:

first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
first_name = 'John'

Explanation:
first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means the variable first_name is assigned the string 'John'.

Syntax:
last_name = 'Doe'

Explanation:
last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.

Additional Description of Exercise:

Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:
John Doe

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:
Syntax:
John Doe

Explanation:
John Doe is a string that is "John Doe".
the part of the string "John" is from the first_name variable which is assigned the string 'John'.
the part of the string "Doe" is from the last_name varibale which is assigned the string 'Doe'
this means that the string "John Doe" is probably string interpolation for example something similar to "#{first_name} 
#{last_name}".
this implies puts "John Doe".
puts is put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
this means the syntax is probably something similar to print to the screen the string the string with interpolation
"#{first_name} #{last_name}" that is puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}" which would have the out put of John Doe as the 
part of the string "John" is from the first_name variable which is assigned the string 'John' and the part of the string 
"Doe" is from the last_name varibale which is assigned the string 'Doe'.

Syntax of Solution:

first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'

full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
puts full_name

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
first_name = 'John'

Explanation:
first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means that the varible first_name is assigned the string 'John'.

Syntax:
last_name = 'Doe'

Explanation:
last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.

Syntax:
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

Explanation:
full_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means that the varible first_name is assigned the string 'John'.
+ is used to combine strings together.
' ' this means a space.
+ is used to combine strings together.
last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.
this means the varible full_name is assigned first_name is assigned the string 'John' + is used to combines that with 
' ' which means a space + is used to combines that with the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.

Syntax:
puts full_name

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
full_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means that the varible first_name is assigned the string 'John'.
+ is used to combine strings together.
' ' this means a space.
+ is used to combine strings together.
last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.
this means the varible full_name is assigned first_name is assigned the string 'John' + is used to combines that with 
' ' which means a space + is used to combines that with the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.
this means print to the screen the varible full_name which is assigned first_name is assigned the string 'John' + is used
to combines that with ' ' which means a space + is used to combines that with the variable last_name is assigned the 
string 'Doe' and this has the output John Doe.

Summary of Solution Syntax:

first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means that the varible first_name is assigned the string 'John'.

last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.

full_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
first_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'John' is a string.
this means that the varible first_name is assigned the string 'John'.
+ is used to combine strings together.
' ' this means a space.
+ is used to combine strings together.
last_name is a variable.
= means assignment.
'Doe' is a string.
this means the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.
this means the varible full_name is assigned first_name is assigned the string 'John' + is used to combines that with 
' ' which means a space + is used to combines that with the variable last_name is assigned the string 'Doe'.
this means print to the screen the varible full_name which is assigned first_name is assigned the string 'John' + is used
to combines that with ' ' which means a space + is used to combines that with the variable last_name is assigned the 
string 'Doe' and this has the output John Doe.
