if colors includes the color 'purple' and print false if it doesn't.

Initial Syntax Given:
colors = 'blue pink yellow orange'

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:
colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
'blue pink yellow orange' is a string.
this means the variable colors is assigned the string 'blue pink yellow orange'.

Additional Description of Exercise:
Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:
true
false

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:
true is boolean true.
false is boolean false.
these are outputs so something is printing them probably puts which is put s which is put string which means print to the 
screen the string.
the syntax is something like:
puts  colors includes the color 'yellow' which results in the output boolean true as 'yellow' is in the string
'blue pink yellow orange' which is assigned to the variable colors.
puts colors includes the color 'purple' which results in the output boolean false as purple is not in the string 
'blue pink yellow orange' which is assigned to the variable colors.

Syntax of Solution:

colors = 'blue pink yellow orange'

puts colors.include?('yellow')
puts colors.include?('purple')

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
colors = 'blue pink yellow orange'

Explanation:
colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
'blue pink yellow orange' is a string.
this means the variable colors is assigned the string 'blue pink yellow orange'.

Syntax:
puts colors.include?('yellow')

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
'blue pink yellow orange' is a string.
this means the variable colors is assigned the string 'blue pink yellow orange'.
.include? is a string method checks a string to see if it contains a specific argument as a substring which returns
boolean true if it does and boolean false if it does not.
('yellow') is a string.
this means print to the screen the result of checking if the variable colors that is assigned the string 
'blue pink yellow orange' contains a specific argument as a substring specifically the string 'yellow' returning boolean 
true if it does and boolean false if it does not the result of which is boolean true.
