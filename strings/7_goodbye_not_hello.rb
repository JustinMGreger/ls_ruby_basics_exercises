the second argument.
! is destructive meaning it changes the original version.
('Hello', 'Goodbye') are string arguments.
this means the variable greeting is assigned the string 'Hello!' which experiences global substitution which is a string 
method that replaces all occurences of the first argument it accepts with the second argument by changing the original 
version this is done with the string arguments ('Hello', 'Goodbye') that is the string 'Hello!' that is assigned to 
the variable greeting is replaced with the string 'Goodbye' and therefore is assigned to the variable greeting.
