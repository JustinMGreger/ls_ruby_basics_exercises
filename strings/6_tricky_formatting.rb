Description of Exercise:

Using the following code, capitalize the value of state then print the modified value.
Note that state should have the modified value both before and after you print it.

Initial Syntax Given:

state = 'tExAs'

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
state = 'tExAs'

Explanation:
state is a variable.
= means assignment.
'tExAs' is a string.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs'.

Additional Description of Exercise:

Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:

Texas

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
Texas

Explanation:
Texas is a string.
this implies that the string Texas was printed to the string so probably puts which is put s which is put string which is
print to the screen the string Texas.
this would look like puts "Texas".

Syntax of Solution:

state = 'tExAs'

state.capitalize!
puts state

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
state = 'tExAs'

Explanation:
state is a variable.
= means assignment.
'tExAs' is a string.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs'.

Syntax:
state.capitalize!

Explanation:
state is a variable.
= means assignment.
'tExAs' is a string.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs'.
.capitalize makes the first letter of a string capitalized and the rest of the letters lowercased.
! is destructive that is it permenantly changes the original.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs' and that is changed so that the first letter of the string is
capitalized and the rest of the letters are lowercased.

Syntax:
puts state

Explanation:
puts is put s which means put string which is print to the screen the string.
state is a variable.
= means assignment.
'tExAs' is a string.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs'.
previously in this code the syntax state.capitalize! was used and that is desructive which I will now explain:
.capitalize makes the first letter of a string capitalized and the rest of the letters lowercased.
! is destructive that is it permenantly changes the original.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs' and that is changed so that the first letter of the string is
capitalized and the rest of the letters are lowercased.
this means print to the screen the variable state which is assigned the string 'tExAs' and that was destrucively changed 
earlier in the syntax so that the first letter of the string is capitalized and the rest of the letters are lowercased and
the output of this is Texas.

Summary of Solution Syntax:

state is a variable.
= means assignment.
'tExAs' is a string.
this means the variable state is assigned the string 'tExAs'.
