Explanation:
these are strings printed on their own lines.
printed strings implies puts which is put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
previously in the syntax the variable alphabet  was assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
the solution is probably something like puts alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and then somehow the string
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is broken up so that it is printed on a line for each of the string's characters.

Syntax of Solution:

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
puts alphabet.split('')

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
