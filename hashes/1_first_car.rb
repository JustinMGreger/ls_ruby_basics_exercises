Description of Exercise:

Create a hash that contains the following data and assign it to a variable named car.

Initial Syntax Given:

type	color	mileage
sedan	blue	80_000

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:
type is string assigned sedan which is a string.
color is a string assigned blue which is a string.
mileage is a string assigned 80_000 which is an integer.

Syntax of Solution:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  mileage: 80_000
}

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:    'sedan',

Explanation:
type: is a symbol and a key.
'sedan' is a string and a value.
, indicates additonal key value pairs.
this means that type: is a symbol key that has the 'sedan' string value assigned to it.

Syntax:
  color:   'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol and a key.
'blue' is a string and a value.
, indicates additonal key value pairs.
this means that color: is a symbol key that has the 'blue' string value assigned to it.

Syntax:
  mileage: 80_000

Explanation:
mileage: is a symbol and a key.
80_000 is a integer and a value.
this means that mileage: is a symbol key that has the 80_000 integer value assigned to it.

}

Summary of Solution Syntax:
