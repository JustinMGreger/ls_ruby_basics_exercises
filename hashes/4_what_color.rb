Description of Exercise:

Using the following code, select the value 'blue' from car and print it with #puts.

Initial Syntax Given:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  year:    2003
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open a hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:    'sedan',

Explanation:
type: is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
  color:   'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means color: is a symbol key assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
  year:    2003

Explanation:
year: is a symbol key.
2003 is a integer value.
this means year: is a symbol key assigned the 2003 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanation:
this means close the hash data structure that is everything after this line is outside of the hash data structure.

Syntax of Solution:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  year:    2003
}

puts car[:color]

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open a hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:    'sedan',

Explanation:
type: is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
  color:   'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means color: is a symbol key assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
  year:    2003

Explanation:
year: is a symbol key.
2003 is a integer value.
this means year: is a symbol key assigned the 2003 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanation:
this means close the hash data structure that is everything after this line is outside of the hash data structure.

Syntax:
puts car[:color]

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open a hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure.
type: is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.
color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means color: is a symbol key assigned the 'blue' string value.
year: is a symbol key.
2003 is a integer value.
this means year: is a symbol key assigned the 2003 integer value.
this means close the hash data structure that is everything after this line is outside of the hash data structure.
Hash[] returns the value associated with the given key.
color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs after this.
this means color: is a symbol key assigned the 'blue' string value.
this means print to the screen car[:color] which is the return the value associated with the given key color: 
which is a symbol key assigned the 'blue' string value from within the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure 
containing: type: which is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value, color: which is a symbol key assigned the 
'blue' string value, year: which is a symbol key assigned the 2003 integer value.
the output is: blue
