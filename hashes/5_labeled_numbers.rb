Description of Exercise:
Use Hash#each to iterate over numbers and print each element's key/value pair.

Initial Syntax Given:
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
numbers = {

Explanation:
numbers is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open a hash data structure.
this means the variable numbers is assigned to a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  high:   100,

Explanation:
high: is a symbol key.
100 is a integer value.
, means more key value pairs follow this.
this means high: is a symbol key assigned 100 which is a integer value.

Syntax:
  medium: 50,

Explanation:
medium: is a symbol key.
50 is a integer value.
, means more key value pairs follow this.
this means medium: is a symbol key assigned 50 which is a integer value.

Syntax:
  low:    10

Explanation:
low: is a symbol key.
10 is a integer value.
this means low: is a symbol key assigned 10 which is a integer value.
