Description of Exercise:
Use Hash#each to iterate over numbers and print each element's key/value pair.

Initial Syntax Given:
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
numbers = {

100 is an integer value.
, means more key value pairs follow this.
this means high: is a symbol key assigned 100 which is an integer value.


  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}
