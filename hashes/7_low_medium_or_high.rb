Description of Exercise:

Use Hash#select to iterate over numbers and return a hash containing only key-value pairs where the value is less than 25.
Assign the returned hash to a variable named low_numbers and print its value using #p.

Initial Syntax Given:

numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
numbers = {

Explanaiton:
numbers is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open a hash data structure.
this means the variable numbers is assigned a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  high:   100,

Explanation:
high: is a symbol key.
100 is a integer value.
, means more key value pairs following this.
this means high: is a symbol key that is assigned the 100 integer value.

Syntax:
  medium: 50,

Explantion:
medium: is a symbol key.
50 is a integer key.
, means more key value pairs following this.
this means medium: is a symbol key that is assigned the 50 integer value.

Syntax:
  low:    10

Explanation:
low: is a symbol key.
10 is a integer value.
this means low: is a symbol key assigned the 10 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanation:
this means close the hash data structure that is everything after this line is outside of the hash data structure.
