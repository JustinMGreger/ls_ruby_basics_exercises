Description of Exercise:

Rewrite car as a nested array containing the same key-value pairs.

Initial Syntax Given:

car = {
  type:  'sedan',
  color: 'blue',
  year:  2003
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:  'sedan',

Explanation:
type: is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs follow this.
this means the type: symbol key is assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
  color: 'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
, means more key value pairs follow this.
this means the color: symbol key is assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
  year:  2003

Explanation:
year: is a symbol key.
2003 is a integer value.
this means the year: symbol key is assigned the 2003 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanation:
} means close the hash data structure.

Syntax of Solution:

car = [[:type, 'sedan'], [:color, 'blue'], [:year, 2003]]

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
car = [[:type, 'sedan'], [:color, 'blue'], [:year, 2003]]

Explanation:

Summary of Solution Syntax:
