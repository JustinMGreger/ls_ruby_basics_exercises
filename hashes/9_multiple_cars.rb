Description of Exercise:
Create a nested hash using the following data.

Initial Syntax Given:

Car

type	color	year
sedan	blue	2003

Truck

type	color	year
pickup red	1998

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
Car

Explanation:
Car is a hash data structure.

Syntax:
type	
sedan	

Explanation:
type: is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
this means the type: symbol key is assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
color	
blue	

color: is a symbol key.
'blue' is a string value.
this means the color: symbol key is assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
year
2003

Explanation:
year: is a symbol key.
2003 is a integer value.
this means the year: symbol key is assigned the 2003 integer value.

Summary of Car hash data structure:
this means the Car data structure is assigned a hash data structure containing: type: symbol key which is assigned the 
'sedan' string value, color: symbol key which is assigned the 'blue' string value, year: symbol key which is assigned the 
2003 integer value.

Syntax:
Truck

Explanation:
Truck  is a hash data structure.

Syntax:
type	
pickup 

Explanation:
type: is a symbol key.
'pickup' is a string value.
this means the type: symbol key is assigned the 'pickup' string value.

Syntax:
color	
red	

Explanation:
color: is a symbol key.
'red' is a string value.
this means the color: symbol key is assigned the 'red' string value.

Syntax:
year
1998

Explanaiton:
year: is a symbol key.
1998 is a integer value.
this means the year: symbol key is assigned the 1998 integer value.

Summary of Truck hash data structure:
this means the Truck data structure is assigned a hash data structure containing: type: symbol key which is assigned the 
'pickup' string value, color: symbol key which is assigned the 'red' string value, year: symbol key which is assigned the 
1998 integer value.
