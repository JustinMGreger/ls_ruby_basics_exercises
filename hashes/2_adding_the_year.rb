Description of Exercise:

Using the code below, add the key :year and the value 2003 to car.

Initial Syntax Given:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  mileage: 80_000
}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignemnt.
{ means open hash data structure.
this means the variable car is assigned to a hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:    'sedan',

Explanation:
type: is a symbol and a key.
'sedan' is a string and a value.
, means there are more key value pairs following.
this means type: is a symbol key that is assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
  color:   'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol and a key.
'blue' is a string and a value.
, means there are more key value pairs following.
this means color: is a symbol key that is assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
  mileage: 80_000

Explanation:
mileage: is a symbol and a key.
80_000 is a integer and a value.
this means mileage is a symbol key that is assigned the 80_000 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanaiton:
this is the end of the hash data structure that is everything after this is outside of the hash data structure.

Syntax of Solution:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  mileage: 80_000
}

car[:year] = 2003

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
car = {

Explanation:
car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open hash data structure.

Syntax:
  type:    'sedan',

Explanation:
type is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means there are more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.

Syntax:
  color:   'blue',

Explanation:
color: is a symbol and a key.
'blue' is a string and a value.
, means there are more key value pairs following.
this means color: is a symbol key that is assigned the 'blue' string value.

Syntax:
  mileage: 80_000

Explanation:
mileage: is a symbol and a key.
80_000 is a integer and a value.
this means mileage is a symbol key that is assigned the 80_000 integer value.

Syntax:
}

Explanaiton:
this is the end of the hash data structure that is everything after this is outside of the hash data structure.

car[:year] = 2003

Summary of Solution Syntax:

car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open hash data structure.
type is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means there are more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.
color: is a symbol and a key.
'blue' is a string and a value.
, means there are more key value pairs following.
this means color: is a symbol key that is assigned the 'blue' string value.
mileage: is a symbol and a key.
80_000 is a integer and a value.
this means mileage is a symbol key that is assigned the 80_000 integer value.
this is the end of the hash data structure that is everything after this is outside of the hash data structure.

This means:

car is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ means open hash data structure.
type is a symbol key.
'sedan' is a string value.
, means there are more key value pairs after this.
this means type: is a symbol key assigned the 'sedan' string value.
color: is a symbol and a key.
'blue' is a string and a value.
, means there are more key value pairs following.
this means color: is a symbol key that is assigned the 'blue' string value.
mileage: is a symbol and a key.
80_000 is a integer and a value.
this means mileage is a symbol key that is assigned the 80_000 integer value.
this is the end of the hash data structure that is everything after this is outside of the hash data structure.
