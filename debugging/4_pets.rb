Description of Exercise:

Magdalena has just adopted a new pet! 
She wants to add her new dog, Bowser, to the pets hash. 
After doing so, she realizes that her dogs Sparky and Fido have been mistakenly removed. 
Help Magdalena fix her code so that all three of her dogs' names will be associated with the key :dog in the pets hash.

Initial Syntax Given:

pets = { cat: 'fluffy', dog: ['sparky', 'fido'], fish: 'oscar' }

pets[:dog] = 'bowser'

p pets #=> {:cat=>"fluffy", :dog=>"bowser", :fish=>"oscar"}

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
pets = { cat: 'fluffy', dog: ['sparky', 'fido'], fish: 'oscar' }

Explanation:
pets is a variable.
= means assignment.
{ cat: 'fluffy', dog: ['sparky', 'fido'], fish: 'oscar' } is a hash data structure..
{ means open the hash data structure.
cat: is a symbol key assigned the 'fluffy' string value.
dog: is a symbol key assigned the ['sparky', 'fido'] array of 'sparky' and 'fido' string values.
fish: is a symbol key assigned the 'oscar' string value.
} means close the hash data structure that is everything after this is outside of the hash data structure.
this means:
the pets variable is assigned the { cat: 'fluffy', dog: ['sparky', 'fido'], fish: 'oscar' } hash data structure which 
contains: the cat: symbol key which is assigned the 'fluffy' string value, the dog: symbol key which is assigned the 
['sparky', 'fido'] array of 'sparky' and 'fido' string values, the fish: symbol key which is assigned the 'oscar' string 
value.



pets[:dog] = 'bowser'

p pets #=> {:cat=>"fluffy", :dog=>"bowser", :fish=>"oscar"}
