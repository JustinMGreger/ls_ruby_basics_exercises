Description of Exercise:
Write a loop that prints numbers 1-5 and whether the number is even or odd. 
Use the code below to get started.

Syntax of Initial Code:
count = 1

loop do
  count += 1
end

Explanation of Initial Code:

Syntax:
count = 1

Explanation:
local variable "count" is assigne to "1".

Syntax:
loop do

Explanation:
loop do means run loop which means repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

Syntax:
 count += 1

Explanation:
count = count + 1
That is count is reassigned to count + 1.

Summary of Initial Code:
local variable "count" is assigne to "1".
loop do means run loop which means repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
"count" is reassigned to count + 1.
The initial code produces an infinite loop that reassigns count which begins at the value of 1 to count + 1.
Which means count which is intially assigned to 1 is incremented by 1 for infinity.

Expected Output:
1 is odd!
2 is even!
3 is odd!
4 is even!
5 is odd!
