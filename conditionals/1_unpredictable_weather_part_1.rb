Description of Exercise:

In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

Initial Syntax Given:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.

Syntax of Solution:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

if sun == 'visible'
  puts 'The sun is so bright!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Syntax:
if sun == 'visible'

Explanation:
if statement means if a condition is boolean true then do something.
sun is assigned to the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].
== means equal.
'visible' is a string that is an element in the sun array.
this means if the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'] and if that
is specifically equal to the string 'visible' which is an element in the sun array then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'The sun is so bright!'

Explanation:
puts is put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
'The sun is so bright!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'The sun is so bright!'.

Syntax:
end

Explanation:
this is the last line of the if statement that is everything after this is outside of the if statement.

Summary of Solution Syntax:

sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].
