Description of Exercise:

In the code below, status is randomly assigned as 'awake' or 'tired'.

Initial Syntax Given:

status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

Explanation:
status is a variable.
= means assignment.
['awake', 'tired'] is array of string.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements from an array.
this means the variable status is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array ['awake', 'tired'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write an if statement that returns "Be productive!" if status equals 'awake' and returns "Go to sleep!" otherwise. 
Then, assign the return value of the if statement to a variable and print that variable.

Syntax of Solution:

status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

alert = if status == 'awake'
          'Be productive!'
        else
          'Go to sleep!'
        end

puts alert

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

Explanation:
status is a variable.
= means assignment.
['awake', 'tired'] is array of string.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements from an array.
this means the variable status is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array ['awake', 'tired'].

Syntax:
alert = if status == 'awake'

Explanation:
alert is a variable.
= means assignment.
if is an if statement that means if something is boolean true then do something.
status is a variable.
= means assignment.
['awake', 'tired'] is array of string.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements from an array.
this means the variable status is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array ['awake', 'tired'].
== means equals to.
'awake' is a string element.
this means the variable alert is assigned to the variable status which is assigned the randomly selected string element 
from the array ['awake', 'tired'] and if the variable status is equal to the string element 'awake' then do something.

Syntax:
          'Be productive!'

Explanation:
'Be productive!' is a string.

Syntax:
        else

Explanation:
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:

Syntax:
          'Go to sleep!'

Explanation:
'Go to sleep!' is a string.

Syntax:
        end

Explanation:
this is the last line of the if statement that is everything after this line is outside of the if statement.

Syntax:
puts alert

Explanation:
puts is put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
alert is a variable.
= means assignment.
if is an if statement that means if something is boolean true then do something.
status is a variable.
= means assignment.
['awake', 'tired'] is array of string.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements from an array.
this means the variable status is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array ['awake', 'tired'].
== means equals to.
'awake' is a string element.
this means the variable alert is assigned to the variable status which is assigned the randomly selected string element 
from the array ['awake', 'tired'] and if the variable status is equal to the string element 'awake' then do something.
'Be productive!' is a string.
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:
'Go to sleep!' is a string.
this is the last line of the if statement that is everything after this line is outside of the if statement.
this means print to the screen the variable alert which is assigned to the variable status which is assigned the randomly
selected string element from the array ['awake', 'tired'] and if the variable status is equal to the string element 
'awake' then return the string 'Be productive!' if status does not equal the string element 'awake' then return the string
'Go to sleep!'
this is the last line of the if statement that is everything after this line is outside of the if statement.

Summary of Solution Syntax:

'awake' then return the string 'Be productive!' if status does not equal the string element 'awake' then return the string
'Go to sleep!'
this is the last line of the if statement that is everything after this line is outside of the if statement.

This means:
