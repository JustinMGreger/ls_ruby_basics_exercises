Description of Exercise:

Reformat the following case statement so that it only takes up 5 lines.

Initial Syntax Given:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:

stoplight is a variable.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight

Explanation:
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] and compared to the following:

Syntax:
when 'green'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'green' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'green' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Go!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Go!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Go!'.

Syntax:
when 'yellow'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'yellow' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'yellow' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Slow down!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Slow down!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Slow down!'.

Syntax:
else

Explanation:
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:

Syntax:
  puts 'Stop!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Stop!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Stop!'.

Syntax:
end

Explanation:
this is the last line of the case statement that is everything after this line is outside of the case statement.

Syntax of Solution:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'  then puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow' then puts 'Slow down!'
else               puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:
stoplight is a variable.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight

Explanation:
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] and compared to the following:

Syntax:
when 'green'  then puts 'Go!'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'green' is a string.
then is a reserved word used for transition between condition and operation.
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Go!' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'green' then print to the screen the string 'Go!'.

Syntax:
when 'yellow' then puts 'Slow down!'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'yellow' is a string.
then is a reserved word used for transition between condition and operation.
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Slow down!' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'yellow' then print to the screen the string 'Slow down!'.

Syntax:
else               puts 'Stop!'

Explanation:
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Stop!' is a string.
this means if all of the above is false then print to the screen the string 'Stop!'.
