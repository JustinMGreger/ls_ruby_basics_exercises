Description of Exercise:

Reformat the following case statement so that it only takes up 5 lines.

Initial Syntax Given:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:

stoplight is a variable.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight

Explanation:
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of strings.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] and compared to the following:

Syntax:
when 'green'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'green' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'green' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Go!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Go!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Go!'.

Syntax:
when 'yellow'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'yellow' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'yellow' then do something.

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Stop!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Stop!'.
