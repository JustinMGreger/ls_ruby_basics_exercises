Description of Exercise:

In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

Initial Syntax Given:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals 'visible'.


Syntax of Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

unless sun == 'visible'
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Syntax:
unless sun == 'visible'

Explanation:
unless statement means do something if a condition is false.
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
== means equal to.
'visible' is a string element in the sun array.
this means that if the variable sun which is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
is not equal to 'visible' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'The clouds are blocking the sun!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'

end

Summary of Solution Syntax:

sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
== means equal to.
'visible' is a string element in the sun array.
this means that if the variable sun which is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
is not equal to 'visible' then do something.
  
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'The clouds are blocking the sun!' is a string.
