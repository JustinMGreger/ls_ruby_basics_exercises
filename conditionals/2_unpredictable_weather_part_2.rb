sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Syntax of Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

unless sun == 'visible'
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].


unless sun == 'visible'
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
end
