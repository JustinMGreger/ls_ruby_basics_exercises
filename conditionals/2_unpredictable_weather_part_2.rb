Description of Exercise:

In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

Initial Syntax Given:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals 'visible'.


Syntax of Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

unless sun == 'visible'
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Explanation:
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

Syntax:
unless sun == 'visible'

Explanation:
unless statement means do something if a condition is false.
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
== means equal to.
'visible' is a string element in the sun array.
this means that if the variable sun which is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
is not equal to 'visible' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'The clouds are blocking the sun!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'

Syntax:
end

Explanation:
this is the last line of the unless statement that is everything after this line is outside of the unless statement.

Summary of Solution Syntax:

sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

unless statement means do something if a condition is false.
sun is a variable.
= means assignment.
['visible', 'hidden'] is an array of elements.
.sample is a method that randomly selects an element from an array.
this means the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
== means equal to.
'visible' is a string element in the sun array.
this means that if the variable sun which is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
is not equal to 'visible' then do something.
  
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'The clouds are blocking the sun!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'

this is the last line of the unless statement that is everything after this line is outside of the unless statement.

This means:

the variable sun is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden'].

if the variable sun which is assigned the randomly selected element from the array ['visible', 'hidden']
is not equal to the string 'visible' then print to the screen the string 'The clouds are blocking the sun!'
