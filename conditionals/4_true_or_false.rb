Description of Exercise:

In the code below, boolean is randomly assigned as true or false.

Initial Syntax Given:

boolean = [true, false].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
boolean = [true, false].sample

Explanation:
boolean is a variable.
= means assignment.
[true, false] is an array of elements.
true and false are elements in the array.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements in an array.
this means that the variable boolean is assigned a randomly selected element from the array [true, false].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write a ternary operator that prints "I'm true!" if boolean equals true and prints "I'm false!" if boolean equals false.

Syntax of Solution:

boolean = [true, false].sample

boolean ? puts("I'm true!") : puts("I'm false!")

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
boolean = [true, false].sample

Explanation:
boolean is a variable.
= means assignment.
[true, false] is an array of elements.
true and false are elements in the array.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements in an array.
this means that the variable boolean is assigned a randomly selected element from the array [true, false].

Syntax:
boolean ? puts("I'm true!") : puts("I'm false!")

Explanation:
boolean is a variable.
= means assignment.
[true, false] is an array of elements.
true and false are elements in the array.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects elements in an array.
this means that the variable boolean is assigned a randomly selected element from the array [true, false].
this is a ternary operator that follows the format <condition> ? <result if true> : <result if false>
? means if boolean true or false.
puts means put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
("I'm true!") is a string.
: means seperation.
puts means put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
("I'm false!") is a string.

this means:
that the variable boolean is assigned a randomly selected element from the array [true, false] if true then
print to the screen the string ("I'm true!") and if false print to the screen the string ("I'm false!").
