7 is an integer.
this means the variable number is assigned to the integer 7.

if statements mean if boolean true then do something.
number is the variable number.

This means:

the variable number is assigned to the integer 7.

if the number is boolean true then print to the screen the string "My favorite number is #{number}." which is string 
interpolation referencing the varaible number.
if the number variable is boolean false then print to the screen the string "I don't have a favorite number."

the result of this is:
the variable number is assigned to the integer 7 and this is default boolean true which means
