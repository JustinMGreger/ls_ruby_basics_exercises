Description of Exercise:

In the code below, stoplight is randomly assigned as 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

Initial Syntax Given:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:
stoplight is a variable.
= is assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from the array of elements.
this means the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Additional Description of Exercise:

Write a case statement that prints "Go!" if stoplight equals 'green', "Slow down!" if stoplight equals 'yellow', and 
"Stop!" if stoplight equals 'red'.

Syntax of Solution:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:
stoplight is a variable.
= is assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from the array of elements.
this means the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight

Explanation:
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= is assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from the array of elements.
this means the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array ['green', 'yellow', 'red'] 
and compared to the following:

Syntax:
when 'green'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'green' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'green' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Go!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Go!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Go!'.

Syntax:
when 'yellow'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'yellow' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'yellow' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Slow down!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Slow down!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Slow down!'.

Syntax:
else

Explanation:
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:

Syntax:
  puts 'Stop!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Stop!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Stop!'.


end
