Description of Exercise:

Convert the following case statement to an if statement.

Initial Syntax Given:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:
stoplight is a variable.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects from the elements.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned to the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= is assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from the array of elements.
this means the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array ['green', 'yellow', 'red'] 
and compared to the following:


when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end
