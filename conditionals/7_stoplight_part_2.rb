Description of Exercise:

Convert the following case statement to an if statement.

Initial Syntax Given:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Explanation:
stoplight is a variable.
= means assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects from the elements.
this means the variable stoplight is assigned to the randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'].

Syntax:
case stoplight
case statements are used to compare multiple values to a single case.
stoplight is a variable and the case.
= is assignment.
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is an array of string elements.
.sample is an array method that randomly selects an element from the array of elements.
this means the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array ['green', 'yellow', 'red'] 
and compared to the following:

Syntax:
when 'green'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'green' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'green' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Go!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Go!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Go!'.

Syntax:
when 'yellow'

Explanation:
when means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is something then do something.
'yellow' is a string.
this means when the case that is the stoplight variable is assigned a randomly selected string element from the array 
['green', 'yellow', 'red'] is assigned the string 'yellow' then do something.

Syntax:
  puts 'Slow down!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Slow down!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Slow down!'.

Syntax:
else

Explanation:
else means if all of the above is false then do the following:

Syntax:
  puts 'Stop!'

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
'Stop!' is a string.
this means print to the screen the string 'Stop!'.
