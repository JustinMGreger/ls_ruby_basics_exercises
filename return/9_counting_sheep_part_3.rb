Initial Syntax Given:

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
def count_sheep

Syntax:
    if sheep >= 2

Explanation:
if statements mean if something is boolean true then do something.
sheep is a block variable |sheep| is used to capture the iteration number.
>= this means greater than or equal to.

      return

Explanation:
return means exit the method and return the value.

    end
  end
end
