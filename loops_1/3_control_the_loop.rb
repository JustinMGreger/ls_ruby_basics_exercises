Description of Exercise:
Modify the following loop so it iterates 5 times instead of just once.

Syntax:
iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  break
end

Description of Solution:
Syntax:
iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  break
end
Explanation:
The loop runs with an iteration of 1.
After the loop puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}" it breaks.
The break reserved word exits the loop.
