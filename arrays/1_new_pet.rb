Description of Exercise:
In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

Initial Syntax Given:
pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:
pets is a varible.
= means assignment. 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].

Additional Description of Exercise:
Select 'fish' from pets, assign the return value to a variable named my_pet, then print the value of my_pet.
Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:
I have a pet fish!

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:
this is a string with interpolation.
my_pet is a variable that is assigned the string 'fish'.
this was printed so that is puts which is put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
the syntax is probably puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"

Syntax of Solution:

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pet = pets[2]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"


Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

Explanation:
pets is a varible.
= means assignment. 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].

Syntax:
my_pet = pets[2]

Explanation:
my_pet is a variable.
= means assignment.
pets is a varible.
= means assignment. 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].
[2] is array index 2 which is used to access the element from an array it is important to remember that index 0 references
the first element meaning that index 2 is the third element of the array.
this means the variable my_pet is assigned the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] which has the index 2 accessed which is the third element which is the string 'fish'
that is the variable my_pet is assigned the string 'fish'.

Syntax:
puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
"I have a pet #{my_pet}!" is a string.
#{my_pet} is string interpolation referencing the variable my_pet.
my_pet is a variable.
= means assignment.
pets is a varible.
= means assignment. 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].
[2] is array index 2 which is used to access the element from an array it is important to remember that index 0 references
the first element meaning that index 2 is the third element of the array.
this means the variable my_pet is assigned the varible pets is assigned the array of string elements 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] which has the index 2 accessed which is the third element which is the string 'fish'
that is the variable my_pet is assigned the string 'fish'.
this means print to the screen the string "I have a pet #{my_pet}!" which has string interpolation #{my_pet} which
references the variable my_pet which is assigned the varible pets which is assigned the array of string elements 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] which has the index 2 accessed which is the third element which is the string 'fish'
that is the variable my_pet is assigned the string 'fish' which results in the output I have a pet fish!

Summary of Solution Syntax:
