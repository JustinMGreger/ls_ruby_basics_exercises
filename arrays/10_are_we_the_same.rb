Description of Exercise:

In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two variables, array1 and array2.

Initial Syntax Given:

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
array1 = [1, 5, 9]

Explanation:
array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].

Syntax:
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

Explanation:
array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].

Additional Description of Exercise:
Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.

Syntax of Solution:

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

puts array1 == array2

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

puts array1 == array2

Summary of Solution Syntax:
This means:
