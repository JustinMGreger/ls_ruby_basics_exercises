Description of Exercise:

In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two variables, array1 and array2.

Initial Syntax Given:

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
array1 = [1, 5, 9]

Explanation:
array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].

Syntax:
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

Explanation:
array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].

Additional Description of Exercise:
Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.

Syntax of Solution:

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

puts array1 == array2

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
array1 = [1, 5, 9]

Explanation:
array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].

Syntax:
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

Explanation:
array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].

Syntax:
puts array1 == array2

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].
== means equals and return boolean true if the compared values are equal and false if they are not.
array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].
this means print to the screen boolean true if the variable array1 which is assigned the array of integer elements 
[1, 5, 9] is equal to the variable array2 which is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5] and return boolean
false if it is not equal.
the result of which is the output: false

Summary of Solution Syntax:

array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].

array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].

puts means put s which is put string which means print to the screen the string.
array1 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 5, 9] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].
== means equals and return boolean true if the compared values are equal and false if they are not.
array2 is a variable.
= means assignment.
[1, 9, 5] is an array of integer elements.
this means the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].
this means print to the screen boolean true if the variable array1 which is assigned the array of integer elements 
[1, 5, 9] is equal to the variable array2 which is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5] and return boolean
false if it is not equal.
the result of which is the output: false

This means:

the variable array1 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9].

the variable array2 is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5].

print to the screen boolean true if the variable array1 which is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 5, 9] is equal
to the variable array2 which is assigned the array of integer elements [1, 9, 5] and return boolean false if it is not 
equal.
the result of which is the output: false
