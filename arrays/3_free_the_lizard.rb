[2..3] of ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] are index locations where [2] is the string element 'fish' and [3] is string 
element 'lizard' that is [2..3] is a range of index locations.
this means that the variable my_pets is assigned to the range of index locations [2..3] of the the variable pets which is 
assigned to the array of strings ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] where [2] is the string element 'fish' and [3] is string
