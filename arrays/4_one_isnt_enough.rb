Description of Exercise:

Without changing the code below, select 'dog' from pets, add the return value to my_pets, then print the value of my_pets.

Initial Syntax Given:

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
my_pets = pets[2..3]
my_pets.pop

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

Explanation:
pets is a variable.
= means assignment.
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable pets is assigned to the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].

Syntax:
my_pets = pets[2..3]

Explanation:
my_pets is a variable.
= means assignment.
pets is a variable.
= means assignment.
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable pets is assigned to the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'].
[2..3] is a range of index location for the array of string elements ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] that is
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'][2..3] accesses the string element 'fish' for index location [2] and the string element
'lizard' for index location [3].
this means the variable my_pets is assigned the variable pets which is assigned to the array of string elements 
['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard'] which is accessed by the range of index locations [2..3] that is the string element 'fish'
for index location [2] and the string element 'lizard' for index location [3].
