Description of Exercise:

In the code below, a nested array containing three groups of names and numbers is assigned to favorites.

Initial Syntax Given:
favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:
favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]] is a nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements.
this means the favorites variable is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements 
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].

Additional Description of Exercise:
Flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result should not have any subarrays, 
but should have all of the original strings and numbers from the original array:

Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:
["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:
this is an array of string elments and integer elements that was probably assigned to a variable.
this was output on one line so p was used.
the syntax is probably something like p flat_favorites.

Syntax of Solution:

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten

p flat_favorites

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

Explanation:
favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]] is a nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements.
this means the favorites variable is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements 
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].

Syntax:
flat_favorites = favorites.flatten

Explanation:
flat_favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]] is a nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements.
this means the favorites variable is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements 
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].
.flatten method returns a new array that contains all of the elements.
this means the variable flat_favorites is assigned the new array that contains all of the elements from the favorites
array which is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements 
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].

Syntax:
p flat_favorites

Explanation:
p means output the value on one line.
flat_favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
favorites is a variable.
= means assignment.
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]] is a nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements.
this means the favorites variable is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer elements 
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].
.flatten method returns a new array that contains all of the elements.
this means output the value on one line for the variable flat_favorites which is assigned the new array that contains all
of the elements from the favorites array which is assigned the nested array of three arrays of string elements and integer
elements [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]].
