Description of Exercise:
In the code below, an array containing different types of colors is assigned to colors.

Initial Syntax Given:
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green']

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:
colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable colors is assigned to the array of string elements ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'].

Additional Description of Exercise:
Use Array#each to iterate over colors and print each element.
Expected output:

Additional Initial Syntax Given:
I'm the color red!
I'm the color yellow!
I'm the color purple!
I'm the color green!

Explanation of Additional Initial Syntax Given:
These are strings with interpolation.
Strings imply that they are printed to the string which is puts.
puts is put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
this is string interpolation syntax such as puts "I'm the color #{red}!".
the "red", "yellow", "purple" and "green" strings are elements from the syntax 
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'].
the elements could be called color as in color in colors.

Syntax of Solution:

colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green']

colors.each do |color|
  puts "I'm the color #{color}!"
end

Explanation of Solution Syntax:

Syntax:
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green']

Explanation:
colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable colors is assigned the array of string elements ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'].

colors.each do |color|
  puts "I'm the color #{color}!"
end

Summary of Solution Syntax:

colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable colors is assigned the array of string elements ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'].

This means:

colors is a variable.
= means assignment.
['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'] is an array of string elements.
this means the variable colors is assigned the array of string elements ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green'].
