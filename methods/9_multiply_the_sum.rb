Description of Exercise:

Write the following methods so that each output is true.

Initial Syntax Given:

puts add(2, 2) == 4
puts add(5, 4) == 9
puts multiply(add(2, 2), add(5, 4)) == 36

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
puts add(2, 2) == 4

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
add is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
add is the method.
(2, 2) are integers.
== means equal to and returns boolean true or false.
4 is an integer.
this means print to the screen the boolean true or false result of comparing if the add method accepting the arugments
integer 2 and integer 2 are equal to integer 4.

Syntax:
puts add(5, 4) == 9

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
add is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
add is the method.
(5, 4) are integers and arguments.
== means equal to and returns boolean true or false.
9 is an integer.
this means print to the screen the boolean true or false result of comparing if the add method accepting the arugments
integer 5 and integer 4 are equal to integer 9.

Syntax:
puts multiply(add(2, 2), add(5, 4)) == 36

Explanation
puts means put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
multiply is a function that takes two arguments and returns their product.
multiply is the method.
add(2, 2) and add(5, 4) are arguments.
add is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
add is the method.
(2, 2) are integers and arguments.
add is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
add is the method.
(5, 4) are integers and arguments.
== means equal to and returns boolean true or false.
36 is an integer.
this means print to the screen the boolean true or false result of comparing if the product of the add method accepting 
the arugments integer 2 and integer 2 and the add method accepting the arugments integer 5 and integer 4 is equal to the
integer 36.
