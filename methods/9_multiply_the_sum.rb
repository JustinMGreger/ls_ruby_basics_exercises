Description of Exercise:

Write the following methods so that each output is true.

Initial Syntax Given:

puts add(2, 2) == 4
puts add(5, 4) == 9
puts multiply(add(2, 2), add(5, 4)) == 36

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
puts add(2, 2) == 4

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
