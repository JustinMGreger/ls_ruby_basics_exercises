Description of Exercise:

The variables below are both assigned to arrays. The first one, names, contains a list of names. 
The second one, activities, contains a list of activities. 
Write the methods name and activity so that they each take the appropriate array and return a random value from it. 
Then write the method sentence that combines both values into a sentence and returns it from the method.

Initial Syntax Given:

names = ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica']
activities = ['walking', 'running', 'cycling']

puts sentence(name(names), activity(activities))

Explanation of Initial Syntax Given:

Syntax:
names = ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica']

Explanation:
names is a variable.
names is assigned the array of elements ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica'].

Syntax:
activities = ['walking', 'running', 'cycling']

Explanation:
activities is a variable.
activities is assigned the array of elements ['walking', 'running', 'cycling'].

Syntax:
puts sentence(name(names), activity(activities))

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which means print the string to the screen.
sentence is a method.
the sentence method accepts the arguments name and activity.
name is a method.
the name method accepts the argument names.
names is a variable that is assigned the array of elements ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica'].
activity is a method.
the activity method accepts the argument activities.
activities is a variable that is assigned the array of elements ['walking', 'running', 'cycling'].
this means print to the screen result of the sentence method accepting the arguments name and activity where the name 
method accepts the argument names which is a variable that is assigned the array of elements 
['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica'] and activity method accepts the argument activities which is a variable that is 
assigned the array of elements ['walking', 'running', 'cycling'].
